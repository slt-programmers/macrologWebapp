          This is the amount of calories you need to maintain your current

        <p>
          The first step is to add food to your database. You do this by using
          the floating plus-button in the bottom right corner on the diary page.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-bold">Portions</h2>
        <p>
          To make diary entries easier you can add portions that you regularly
          use. This is entirely optional. You add a portion by clicking on the
          plus sign.
        </p>

          <p>
            Macrolog is not hooked up to an existing food database. This has two
            reasons. First, a shared database is likely to have a multitude of
            variations of the food you are trying to find, including different
            brands and different portions. This may feel overwhelming and it's
            easy to pick something that may not be representative of what you
            actually ate. Second, it forces you to look up the nutrients of your
            food. By adding it to your own personal database manually you
            actively increase your knowledge of what your food consists of,
            instead of passively copying numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This choice does have a trade off. In the beginning it may take some
            time to fill up your database. We know when an app requires a lot of
            tedious action you will stop using it all together, so we try to
            make the daily use of it as easy and fast as possible. We think it's
            best to invest a little time at the start, and once it's set up
            don't spend a second longer on it than you have to. Your time is
            valuable.
