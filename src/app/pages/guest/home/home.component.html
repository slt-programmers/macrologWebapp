        <h1 class="title">Track all the things</h1>

        <p>
          Whatever your goal is, the bottom line in changing your body is simple. To lose weight you consume less energy
          than you burn, and to gain weight you eat more than you burn. How do you know what you're doing is effective?
          Track it! Track your methods, track your progress, track all the things. Macrolog can help you keep an
          overview of the food you eat, your activities and your progress in terms of
          weight. The purpose is to collect data, and see what works for you.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Macronutrients</h2>
        <p>
          Part of tracking everything is also tracking the proportions in which you eat. Macrolog, as the name suggests,
          is more focussed on tracking macronutrients rather than just calories. We won't pretend to know much about
          dieting itself, and what works for one person may not work for another. But we know proteins do something else
          to your body than fat does, and fat acts differently from carbohydrates. Not tracking macronutrients would be
          neglecting data that could play a huge role in accomplishing your physical goal. It should be the basis rather
          than an extra feature.

        <h1 class="title">Simple and quick...</h1>

        <p>
          We think time spend tracking food is time you're not spending on the things you love. Logging food should
          therefore be as easy and quick as possible, without getting inaccurate. Macrolog will help you with this, but
          how?
        </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Just your products</h2>
        <p>
          First off, Macrolog's food list only contains products that you personally use. Other apps are hooked up to
          large
          databases where other users can add to. This sometimes clutters the list and it can be hard to pick the right
          product. Have you ever tried to find the right type of bread amongst the 100 types to pick from? Macrolog's
          list
          starts out empty, and grows over time while you add entries to your diary. You will never be overwhelmed by
          the
          amount of products to pick from. It's just your favorite foods.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Portions</h2>
        <p>
          Second, Macrolog lets you define portions for your products. If you always have the same amount of oats for
          breakfast, you're only gonna enter that quantity once. You can add multiple portions to every food, in case
          you
          eat varying amounts. This speeds up adding food to your diary.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Dishes</h2>
        <p>
          But we didn't stop there.
          If you always have the same amount of oats, yogurt and honey every morning, you're only gonna want to enter
          one thing, your breakfast. This is why Macrolog enables you to define dishes and add all the ingredients at
          once. These ingredient amounts are then fully adjustable, just in case you needed an extra spoon of honey.

        <h1 class="title">... and complex and dynamic</h1>

        <p>
          While the logging must be as simple and easy as possible, the things we want to do with the data are more
          complex. It's nice to see if you reach your daily goals, but you also might want to look at your weekly,
          monthly, or even yearly accomplishments. If you track your eating and exercising habbits for a longer period
          of time you are able to make predictions for the future, should you stick with it. Macrolog offers tools to
          make these aspects visible to you.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Dynamically adjusting goals</h2>
        <p>
          When your body changes, your need for energy changes. When you weigh less, you also need less energy daily.
          And when you've bulked up, you need more energy to sustain that amount of muscle. Macrolog enables you to
          automatically adjust your daily intake goal based on your new physique. This prevents plateauing, which is
          something many people eventually experience when they don't adjust their eating habbits to their new bodily
          needs.

    <h2 class="subtitle">Meal plans</h2>
    <p>We have talked about portions and meals to make logging your food intake easier. But we feel we can still make an
      extra step towards easy entering: meal plans. Macrolog will soon be able to save your weekly meal
      plans, and add the content to your diary automatically every day. This way you only have to log the variations of
      the day.
    </p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Bodyfat and measurements</h2>
    <p>
      We would like Macrolog to be a tool not just for weightloss, but for attaining any physical goal. But changing
      your body composition isnt usually measured in weight, loss or gain. This is why we are adding more types of
      measurements to track your progress, like body fat percentage and bodily measurements.
