          <p>
            Macrolog was developed by two software engineers who wanted to get in shape.
            After using several food tracking applications we got a little tired of
            adds and payed functions which, in our opinion, should be free. So for laughs
            and learning we decided to take it upon ourselves to build a better app.
          </p>

          <p>
            Macrolog heavily focusses on counting macronutrients instead of counting
            calories. We believe that it is healthier and more effective to exactly know what you
            are
            eating.
            This will better help you in accomplishing your pysical goals than just tracking
            calories.
            Now, the concept of the "right" proportions is somewhat debatable, and what works for
            one
            person may not work
            for
            another. We won't pretend to know much about dieting, so during the intake a few
            calculations and suggestions based on mainstream theory will be done. These suggestion
            are entirely free to ignore. </p>

          <p>In the end, we just want to help you measure.</p>
